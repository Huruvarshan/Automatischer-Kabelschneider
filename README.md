# Cable and Heat Shrink Tube Cutter
# Description:
This repository contains the KiCad files and code for the microcontroller of an open-source cable and heat shrink tube cutter. The device is designed to process cables, heat shrink tubes, and similar materials precisely and efficiently.

## Features:

- Programmable length and quantity input via capacitive buttons and display
- Precise cutting mechanism for clean cuts regardless of material and diameter
- Seamless transition between different materials and diameters
- Notification function via small beacons upon completion of the job
- Safety features such as overheat protection, "SawStop," and run-out sensor

## Notes:
- The KiCad files contain the schematics and layouts for manufacturing the device.
- The provided code is intended for programming and controlling the microcontroller.
- Please refer to the safety instructions and maintenance manuals for the device.

This project is an open-source solution for cable and heat shrink tube processing. We welcome contributions and suggestions for improvement from the community!
